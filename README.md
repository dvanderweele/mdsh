## `mdsh`

This is a markdown-enabled terminal or REPL based on a terminal UI that I made with html, css, and javascript with xstate framework. The markdown-to-html parsing is performed by my [smarked](https://dvanderweele.com/smarked) library. I plan to use the terminal with other projects so there are intentionally unused parts of the UI like the history buttons.
